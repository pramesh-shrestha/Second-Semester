//Exercise 2
//    Change the counter example, so this time it looks like slide 37, and you use the tryLock() method.
//    Just do it like the slide. You should see that once again, we donâ€™t reach 2.000.000, because not all the time can the lock be acquired.
//    Try to fix it, so if the lock cannot be obtained, you wait 1 ms and try again.
